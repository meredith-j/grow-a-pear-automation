# grow-a-pear-automation

This is to automate the process of getting plant zone coordinates for Grow-A-Pear. Initial data was provided by Environment Canada, and it will be converted into the correct data type & format through this code.

Grow-A-Pear was originally my final project at bootcamp. I was extremely proud of the work I did but needed to step away from it once school finished. Now that I have more experience coding and have had significant interest from my peers & network in this project, I am thinking of the original iteration of Grow-A-Pear as a product MVP and re-vamping it. My hope is to build an updated version with additional features that people can use to get comfortable gardening!
